# EcoKids_Hub
## Inspiration
In the present era, we find ourselves grappling with numerous challenges arising from climate change. This critical situation stems from a combination of lack of awareness and ignorance. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action to avert further disasters by raising awareness about the significance of a sustainable environment. This very notion served as the impetus behind the inception of our project - EcoKids Hub, an immersive platform designed to educate young children about sustainability. By instilling these vital lessons at a young age, we empower the next generation to proactively address climate change issues and prevent future complications.

## What it does
EcoKids Hub is an interactive, educational app using AI, CV, and LLM to empower children with quizzes, doubts solving, blogs, eco-object recognition, and fun games, fostering a sustainable future mindset.
- EcoKids Hub Daily 🌿🎨Discoveries =  Here kids are provided with a daily thought and fun activity, all focused on a sustainable environment. Let's learn and play our way to a greener world! 🌱🌏🌟 
- EcoKids Hub Doubt Solver 🤔 = Any doubts related to a sustainable environment is solved here. Thus enabling a smooth learning journey for a kid.
- EcoVision = Here kids can type names or upload pics of the surrounding objects. The model will detect the objects and give information of whether those objects are environmentally sustainable or no and why so.
- EcoKids Green Explorers🌱🔍 = Here the model will name an object, kids must find an upload a pic of that object. If the object matches then kids are rewarded and information related to the sustainability of the object is given .
- Quiz = Kids are given questions related to the chosen topic. If answered correctly then they are rewarded.
- Blogs Page = After learning so mush its time t share experience about learning with other and this is platform for that.

## How we built it
This project uses AI, CV, LLM and Streamlit to build EcoKids Hub.
- Streamlit - it is used to build the web app.
- CV = it is used for image processing
- llm = it is used to chat with kids, provide quiz questions, provide more information of topics.

## Challenges we ran into
It was challenging to integrate computer vision with llm. Since this was my first-time using streamlit , learning and making the project was challenging. To build an app for kids in an interactive manner having the UI for kids in mind was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- This project helps kids learn more about the sustainable environment, which gives satisfaction that I am doing my part to spread awareness about climate change. 
-  Integrated CV and LLM in the streamlit app. 
- Good UI
- Education platform for kids for a better palnet.

## What we learned
- I learnt how to use streamlit
- learnt to use LLM in my projects
- Integrate CV with LLM

## What's next for EcoKids Hub
- Real time video processing
- better UI more customised for kids
- gamify the project
 - better reward for kids
